## LAN IP vs WAN IP
LAN IP is your internal (local) IP address that's just for your home devices in your local network. 
The LAN IP won't work outside of the local network.
Ex: 192.168.1.5

WAN IP is your unique address for the web that your ISP gives you (gives your router and you).
You will be uniquely identified by this IP, by the servers in the internet all over the world.
Ex: 117.100.51.10
